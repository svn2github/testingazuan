      <p>For several years, the <a href="http://www.thalesgroup.com/"><b>THALES Group</b></a> and in particular 
      <a href="http://www.thales-is.com/"><b>Thales IS</b></a> bent over the concept of portal. We can assert 
      that we master perfectly this concept with the recent application of the portal 
      (<a href="http://www.impots.gouv.fr/">www.impots.gouv.fr</a>) of the French Ministry of Finance. The quality 
      and success of this portal is not to be any more made. On the portal market, we thus sought and estimated 
      proprietary solutions but also and especially the Open Source solutions. The choice for the solution 
      eXo Platform appeared to us as nature.</p>
      <ul><li>From a functional point of view, the eXo Platform solution allows us to propose quickly to our customers 
      and prospects a rich tool implementing portlets, open and perfectly inter-operable with the other portals 
      or the applications.</li> 
      <li>From an applicative point of view, the construction of the eXo Platform solution fits 
      perfectly the n-third requirements and respects all the Java/J2EE standards.</li>
      <li>From a technical point of view, this tool is the most accomplished by far and the most advanced in development 
      tool, for example the use of JSF.</li></ul>
      <p>All these functional and technical advantages make that we believe in this solution, and that we right 
      now want to bet and to invest (to be an active partner of this Open Source community) on 
      this portal solution.</p>
