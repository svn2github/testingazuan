The
<b>
eXo platform&#153; <i>express</i>
</b>
edition has been created to be used with a simple Java web server - servlet container - such as
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>.
This solution is perfect for a small to medium load charge site.
A large selection of portlets is available for distribution, the most important
presented below:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Core portlets. </b> The selection includes all the administration portlets such as registration,
login/logout, monitors and layout customization,
as well as the edit portlet. The latter allows the
identified users to create portlets' contents via a "What You See Is What You Get" HTML
editor (WYSIWYG). The created document is saved in the CMS directory.</li>

<li><b>Technology wrappers portlets.</b> One of the big advantages of the portlet API is the
opportunity to use several technologies within the portlets, even if the portal itself is built upon some
other technology. Thus, we provide specific portlets such as
Velocity, Struts, Cocoon or a Java Server faces portlet. There
is also an IFrame portlet that allows the introduction of another web application in the portal, making
it possible to use PHP, ASP or CGI applications in Java portlets.
</li>
<li><b>Out of the box portlet. </b> Many ready to use portlets can be bundled with the eXo platform&#153;
express edition - synchroneous and asynchroneous communication tools (chat, forum, e-mail), calendar and
rss (content syndication). </li>
</ul>
<p>
Owing to its light architecture and the powerful set of portlet tools,
the
<b>
eXo platform&#153; <i>express</i> </b>version ideally suites an individual, or a small to medium-sized enterprise
that needs an efficient low-cost portal solution to create and manage its web site.
