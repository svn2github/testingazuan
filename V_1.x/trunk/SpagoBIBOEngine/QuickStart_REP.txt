This document explains how to integrate a Business Object 6.5 document (.rep format) into SpagoBI 1.9.4 platform.
It is assumed to have a SpagoBI 1.9.4 platform containing a properly configured SpagoBIBOEngine instance.
[In order to compile and build such a SpagoBIBOEngine instance, see "How to compile and  install.txt" 
of SpagoBIBODriver and SpagoBIBOEngine projects.]
 

In order to integrate a BO rep report into SpagoBI:

- create a new SpagoBI object 
- associated the new object to the bo engine 
- load a template file with the following structure 
  
  <BO_DOCUMENT>
	   <REP_PROPS name="name report" 
                id="id report" 
                type="rep" 
                repository="name of the bo repository (Example:corporate)"/>
  </BO_DOCUMENT>

- The engine supports PDF and XLS output formats for rep documents: default output format is PDF. In order to choose the output format
  you have to define a parameter with url name "param_output_format" and value PDF or XLS.
  
- If your bo report has some prompt you need to define a SpagoBI parameter for each
  one of them.
  Example: if a BO document has a prompt that ask for matricule number and the prompt name is "Matricule :", 
  you have to define inside SpagoBI platform a parameter that returns all the admissible matricule numbers 
  for the user who is going to execute the document (as per the behavioural model). 
  Then you have to associate that parameter to the SpagoBI document: at this point you have to choose the url name 
  of the document parameter.
  Since the name of the prompt "Matricule :" is not an admissible url name for SpagoBI platform (it contains a space (*)), 
  you have to define a new url name (may be "Matricule_") and to associate it to the existing BO prompt: 
  in order to do this, edit the file (you don't need to restart tomcat)
  TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/SpagoBIBOEngine/WEB-INF/classes/prompts.properties
  and add the following association:
  Matricule_ = Matricule :
  If the BO document has no more prompts, you can execute it and see the result in PDF or XLS format; 
  in case instead the document has one more prompt, the document cannot be refreshed (this is a BO specification) 
  and you will see an error message. You have to build another SpagoBI document parameter for the second BO prompt.

  (*) The SpagoBI parameter url name cannot contain spaces and other special characters, 
  since it will be used as a xml attribute name the SpagoBI core. 
  If the BO prompt does not contain such characters (suppose, for example, the prompt name to be simply "Matricule"), 
  then you can use the same prompt name as SpagoBI parameter url name (without definining the association in prompts.properties).
