	The tester takes the responsibility to verify the formal 
	correctness of the registered documents and if they fulfil 
	the requirements. He can access to a portlet which allows him 
	to execute his documents that are in a test state, by means 
	of the functional tree-view. <br><br>
	The tester can execute a document by simulating all its 
	predefined roles. When the test has been succeeded, he can 
	change the documents' state to production. In this way the 
	document is available for the end user.
