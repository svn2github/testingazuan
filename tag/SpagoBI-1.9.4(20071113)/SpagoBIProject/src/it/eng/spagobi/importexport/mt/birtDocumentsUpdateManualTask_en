INTRO:

Some imported documents are relevant to a version of SpagoBIBirtReportEngine older than 1.9.3.
Those documents use the plugin 'SPAGOBI ECLIPSE BIRT PLUGIN' for the definition of "External (or standard) JDBC Data Source":
thanks to this plugin the connection to the data source were retrieved by the jndi tree on the server or it were directly created, without framework ODA usage.

TODO:

In case the current SpagoBI platform contains SpagoBIBirtReportEngine version 1.9.3, the mentionned plugin is no more supported. 
In order to correct the document, you have to:
- download document template;
- open it with a text editor;
- replace occurrences of string 'org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.subjdbc' with 'org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc';
- upload the modified template.
At this stage, if the document is executed, the engine will try to retrieve the connection to data source through ODA framework.
If you want the connection to be retrieved from the server, you have to:
- open the modified template with BIRT Report Designer 2.2.0 (SpagoBIBirtReportEngine 1.9.3 is compatible with this Birt version);
- configure a report string parameter with name 'connection_name';
- configure data sources 'Property Binding' section as follows:
		JNDI URL: params["connection_name"]
- upload the new template on SpagoBI document detail page;
- define (if it is not present) a SpagoBI parameter which values are the connections' logical names as per file SpagoBIBirtReportEngine\WEB-INF\classes\engine-config.xml;
- use the parameter in the Birt document setting as url name the string "connection_name".

Example:
	Suppose that engine-config.xml is as follows:
	
	<ENGINE-CONFIGURATION>
	
		<CONNECTION 	name="dwh1" 
						isDefault="true" 
						initialContext="java:comp/env"
						resourceName="jdbc/dwh1"/>
						
		<CONNECTION 	name="dwh2" 
						isDefault="false" 
						initialContext="java:comp/env"
						resourceName="jdbc/dwh2"/>
						
	</ENGINE-CONFIGURATION>
	
	Acceptable parameter values for parameter with 'connection_name' url name are "dwh1" or "dwh2".

If the parameter is not configured in the document, connection defined in engine-config.xml with attribute 'isDefault="true"' wins (regardless of any parameter default value defined in the Birt report template).

Note that since SpagoBIBirtReportEngine 1.9.3 engine-config.xml file can contains only jndi connections (with older versions you could define also direct connections).
